Open Justice - India is a project to open up law datasets in India. This includes, but is not limited to:
 
- Court Judgements and Orders, across all levels (Supreme Court, High Courts, District Courts).
- Structure Case Data about cases.
- Causes Lists, and Hearing data, about what cases are heard when.
- Orders and Judgements in Plain Text.
- Indic Language support.
 
While there exist many interfaces to search for this data, such as India Kanoon, 
Judicial Data Grid, or Judgements Search, there aren't any "complete-datasets"
that one can download or play around on something like BigQuery. The closest we have
to this is the [Judicial Data project by Development Data Labs](https://www.devdatalab.org/judicial-data) which covers 
"77 million case records from the Indian eCourts platform from 2010-2018".
 
This project aims to do the same across all court levels continually - and publish
datasets on a regular basis - akin to how Common Crawl does a monthly release. If
you are interested in this effort, please
[join the mailing list](https://groups.io/g/open-justice-in) and introduce yourselves.
